I am working as a researcher at City University of Hong Kong. I got my Ph.D. in Mathematics at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. Lo Wing-Cheong. My interest focuses on applied mathematics related to computational finance and bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in mathematical modelling, data analyzing, dynamics prediction, and control evaluation on natural phenomena either periodic or chaotic, such as economics and epidemics, etc. <br> <br> 


I like the sentence: to be right on keeping track.

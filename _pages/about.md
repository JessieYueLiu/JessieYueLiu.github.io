I am working as a senior engineer in [ASTRI Hong Kong](https://techapplied.astri.org/en/). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lo Wing-Cheong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/wingclo.htm). My research and technical interests focus on machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and leveraging AI to solve practical problems. <br> <br> 




I did interesting reality-modeling, platform-building, and results-analyzing work on practical probelms. My transition from information and computing science to applied math research showed that, I am a fast learner with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I am persistent and ambitious and I love untertaking challenging jobs that require intense work. I like the sentence: to be right on keeping track. Like the master Oogway in《Kung Fu Panda》said: <br>
<font color=Blue> Yesterday is history. <br>
Tomorrow is a mystery. <br>
But today is a gift. <br>
That's why it is called the PRESENT. </font>

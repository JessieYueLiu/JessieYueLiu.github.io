I am working as a researcher at City University of Hong Kong. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lo Wing-Cheong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/wingclo.htm). My interest focuses on applied mathematics related to computational finance and bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in mathematical modelling, data analyzing, dynamics prediction, and control evaluation on natural phenomena either periodic or chaotic, such as economics and epidemics, etc. <br> <br> 





I like the sentence: to be right on keeping track. Like the master Oogway in《Kung Fu Panda》said: <br>
<font color=Blue> Yesterday is history. <br>
Tomorrow is a mystery. <br>
But today is a gift. <br>
That's why it is called the PRESENT. </font>

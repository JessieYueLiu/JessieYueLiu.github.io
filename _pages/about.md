I am working as a researcher at Hong Kong. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lo Wing-Cheong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/wingclo.htm). My research and technic interests focus on federated learning, machine learning, cyber security in FinTech. <br> <br> 




I did interesting modeling, building, and analyzing work on natural phenomena. My transition from information and computing science to applied math research showed that, I am a fast learner with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I am persistent and ambitious and I love untertaking challenging jobs that require intense work. I like the sentence: to be right on keeping track. Like the master Oogway in《Kung Fu Panda》said: <br>
<font color=Blue> Yesterday is history. <br>
Tomorrow is a mystery. <br>
But today is a gift. <br>
That's why it is called the PRESENT. </font>
